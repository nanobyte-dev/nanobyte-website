This page explains how and when your personal data is collected, processed and used when accessing nanobyte.dev or any of its subdomains. Basis of all processing are the terms of the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en) (GDPR).

In the following text we use

- "we" for the people managing the website or in GDPR speak: the controller
- "you" for the users accessing the website or in GDPR speak: the data subject

This text was written to be short and easy to understand by someone who is not a lawyer. If you feel something is not as clear as it should be, please help to improve it.

## Cookies

Cookies are small text files stored by us inside your browser. This allows us to give your browser a short- and long-term memory.

In general, all cookies we set are necessary to provide functionality on our sites. Your browser has settings to control which cookies it accepts and for how long it stores them. [How to enable cookies.](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-enable-cookies/)

Some of the third party services we use (see below) may also set their own cookies. We explain those further down.

## Server Logs

The web server hosting our site will log each page access. This log will also contain some personal data:

- your IP address
- the referrer (where you came from)
- your browser identification

This information is necessary for legal reasons and to analyse and prevent abuse. This allows us to keep users away who try to crash our server or to have necessary evidence in case of illegal or criminal activity.

Our server logs are automatically deleted after 14 days. We will only keep log files longer when they are needed as evidence during an investigation.

## Third Party Processing

Our main principle is to avoid sending any data to third parties, if possible. We don't use any third party analytics, we don't run ads, and we don't even use third party CDNs for delivering static resources like JavaScript libraries or fonts. However, there are situations in which sending data to third parties is unavoidable.

### YouTube and other Videos

Some of our pages may contain videos. We use the "privacy enhanced" `youtube-nocookie.com` domain for YouTube videos. That domain will not track your visit. Your IP address will be visible to YouTube's server though.

Videos embedded from other sources may track your visit.

### Discord, Patreon, GitHub

The data that is collected on the Discord server, the Patreon page and the GitHub organization is outside our direct control. Please consult each platform's privacy policy for information on data collected: [Discord](https://discord.com/privacy), [Patreon](https://privacy.patreon.com/), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Your Rights

The GDPR guarantees your right to information about your personal data, as well as your rights to rectification, erasure, and portability (e.g. for transferring data). Furthermore, you have a right to restriction and objection of processing your data.

Feel free to write an email to admin@nanobyte.dev, so that we can work out how we can help you.

Of course, you also have a right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory data protection authority.
